# Project Title

Depth-First Search Caveman

## Description

Depth-First Search Caveman is a game in which a caveman automatically goes around the cave to look for
a treasure. There are several treasures that are located in different coordinates on the map. That's why,
caveman walks around looking for treasure. If the caveman gets stuck, he backtracks until he finds a direction
which is open for him to go, otherwise it keeps backtracking.

## Motivation

I was motivated to work on this project after learning about different data structures like stacks, queues and
design and algorithm concepts like Depth-First Search and Breadth-First search. Thus, I decided to make
a game that uses Depth-First search, stacks, queues in its implementation in order to show the use of
data structures and algorithmic concepts in the real world.

## Files description

* [main.py](main.py) - this is the file that runs the program
* [gameClass.py](gameClass.py) - all the implementation of the Caveman game is located in this file as a Cave class.
* You can ignore other files with .gif or .txt extensions since they are used by [gameClass.py](gameClass.py) and [main.py](main.py) files.
